The Restaurant and Order Management System is a Spring Boot application designed to manage restaurants, orders, and users efficiently. This application provides APIs for managing restaurant details, user orders, and favorites. It includes functionalities like creating, updating, and deleting restaurants and orders, as well as allowing users to mark restaurants as favorites.


# Security
- The API is secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) handled by Auth0. To access the API, you will need to obtain a JWT by authenticating with the /login endpoint. The JWT should then be passed in the Authorize option available in the Swagger-ui.


## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: JWT is used to manage user authentication and authorization.
- **Role-Based Access**: Different levels of access for users and administrators.
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products and categories.
- **User Management**: Registration and login with encrypted password storage.
- **Order Management**: Track and manage customer orders.
- **RESTful APIs**: Built with scalability and maintainability in mind.
